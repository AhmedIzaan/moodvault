*   **üìä Insightful Data Visualization:**
    *   Dynamic charts and graphs generated with **Matplotlib** and **Pandas** allow users to visualize their mood history.
    *   Includes a line chart for mood scores over time and a pie chart for overall mood frequency.

*   **‚úíÔ∏è Immersive & Themed GUI:**
    *   A beautiful and intuitive user interface built with **PyQt5**.
    *   Features a custom dark-brown, vintage-style theme for a unique and pleasant user experience, with the editor color dynamically changing to reflect the current mood.

*   **üì¶ Portable & Standalone:**
    *   Uses an embedded **SQLite** database, requiring no external database servers or configuration.
    *   Packaged into a single, distributable executable using **PyInstaller**, allowing anyone to run it without installing Python or any dependencies.
